2. Tahun Kabisat

Algoritma
---------
Determine years values
If years value is divisible by 4 and years value is not divisible by 100, so years will be "Tahun Kabisat"
If years value is divisible by 4 and years value is divisible by 100 and also years value divisible by 400, so years will be "Tahun Kabisat" 

Pseudocode
----------
INIT years as years
  STORE years with any values
    IF years mod 4 equals to 0 AND years mod 100 not equals to 0 THEN
      DISPLAY Ini Tahun Kabisat
    IF years mod 4 equals to 0 AND years mod 100 equals to 10 AND years mod 200 equals to 0 THEN
      DISPLAY Ini Tahun Kabisat
    ELSE
      DISPLAY Bukan Tahun Kabisat

    WHILE teacher <= 40
      IF student <= nail-length
        DISPLAY "Bagus!"
      ELSE 
        DISPLAY "Kena Hukum!"
      COMPUTE teacher as teacher+1
ENDWHILE
